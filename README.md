# Hello, world! 👋✨

✨Welcome to my workspace! Would you like a cup of coffee? ☕

My name is Ingrid Almeida, I'm from Brazil 🇧🇷 I'm a curious developer and passionate about creating stuff with technology. I started studying code by myself in November 2020 and I loved it! 💻

Always open to learn something new and always ready to face challenges. 

I really love to share what I'm learning, so if you have any questions, send me a message!
